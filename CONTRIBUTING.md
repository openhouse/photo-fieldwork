Photo Fieldwork welcomes improvements to selection logic, evaluation design, privacy safeguards, catalog adapters, and editor handoffs.

Before opening a change:

1. Run `make demo` and `make check`.
2. Explain which workflow phase the change affects.
3. Add or update a test for behavioral changes.
4. State whether the change touches pixels, OCR, faces, locations, or catalog writes.
5. Include a failure case. A successful example alone is not an evaluation.

Do not commit real private photographs, raw OCR, exact private locations, credentials, contact exports, or personal Photos manifests. Use synthetic fixtures.
